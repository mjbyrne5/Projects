# Projects

  A public collection of my personal projects/ backup for when I make a fatal error during updates. I mainly work with Python for personal endeavors, and also use R and Matlab for more specific applications. I have taken courses in Java as well, but the syntax in Python is written in a way I personally find easier to work with. Plus it has all the sweet math libraries. 

WordleAssistV3.py

  The New York Time's game Wordle was very popular around the time I was first taking courses in computer science after deciding to go back to school in fall 2021. At the time I wondered if I could one day write a program that would give a user all possible words left at any point in their game. I eventually tried to attempt it, and built a working model filled with bugs at 3am one night. Over time I managed to sort out all the errors. After that I wondered if I could teach the program to suggest words with better accuracy than just a random guess. I decided to program it to suggest words based off of which remaining letters were most common, so that wrong guesses will narrow down the remaining words faster. That update managed to work with decent success. It can typically guess a word correctly in 3-5 guesses. I've decided to keep past versions of WordleAssist.py for reference, with the current version being V3. 

FourierSeries3Piecewise.py

  I wrote the Fourier codes while taking a course at ASU on Fourier Analysis for Applied Mathematics majors. I searched the web for a calculator that could calculate A0/An/Bn (even though my professor insisted we do things using the complex version) in a Fourier series for a 3+ piece function, but couldn't find anything higher than a 2 piece calculator. I decided with little confidence to make my own calculator, and for reasons beyond me it somehow worked. My only complaint is I haven't figured out how to display the final result using only integer fractions (other than pi). FourierSeries2Piecewise.py will calculate Fourier coefficients for a 2 piece function and graph the result. FourierSeries3Piecewise.py will do the same for a 3 piece function.
